# Exact Embeddings

This is a Jupyter demo of our LPCA algorithm for exact low-dimensional representations of networks, as described in our paper:
[Node Embeddings and Exact Low-Rank Representations of Complex Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05592)

Also included are sample exact embeddings for five well-known networks.
